                <h2>Missile Man of india</h2>
                <p><b> Abdul Pakir Jainul Abdul Kalam</b> is the missile man of India.
                    is the highest civilian award of the Republic of India. Instituted on 2 January 1954, the award is
                    conferred in
                    recognition of "exceptional service/performance of the highest order", without distinction of race,
                    occupation, position
                    or gender. The award was originally limited to achievements in the arts, literature, science, and
                    public services, but
                    the Government of India expanded the criteria to include "any field of human endeavor" in December
                    2011. The
                    recommendations for the award are made by the Prime Minister to the President. The recipients
                    receive a Sanad
                    (certificate) signed by the President and a peepal leaf-shaped medallion with no monetary grant
                    associated with the
                    award. Bharat Ratna recipients rank seventh in the Indian order of precedence.

                    The first recipients of the Bharat Ratna were: the former Governor-General of the Union of India C.
                    Rajagopalachari, the
                    former President of the Republic of India Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan; and the Indian physicist C. V.
                    Raman, who were
                    honoured in 1954. Since then, the award has been bestowed upon 53 individuals, including 18 who were
                    awarded
                    posthumously. </p>
